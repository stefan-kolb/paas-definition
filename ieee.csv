Due to new methods and new technology development, the reactive systems needs their redefinition. These systems are currently an interesting topic for IT (Information Technology) solution providers. In this paper the authors try to define a new view of the architecture of reactive systems, because reactive systems are evolving and there is no clear definition of them. The starting point of the investigation was the reactive manifesto which defines reactive systems by four main features (quality attributes): responsiveness, resilience, elasticity and message driven interoperability. The mentioned quality attributes are the basis for developing a system solution. For each of the quality attributes, a set of tactics are proposed to maintain attribute required behavior. The suitability of the proposed tactics was investigated for Reactive Sensor Middleware which is part of a CoS (Cloud of Sensors) in the PaaS (Platform as a Service) layer. A cloud of sensors for pollution monitoring in urban areas was used as an example. Verification of the tactics has confirmed that some of the proposed tactics are suitable for the selected CoS subsystem.","","Electronic:978-8-3608-1065-1; POD:978-1-4799-6747-6; USB:978-8-3608-1067-5","10.15439/2015F117","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7321522","Keywords Reactive systems;cloud of sensors;pollution sensing;quality attributes;reactive manifesto;software architecture;tactics","Cloud computing;Computer architecture;Pollution;Resilience;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Sensor systems","cloud computing;middleware;software quality","CoS subsystem;IT solution providers;PaaS layer;cloud of sensors;platform as a service layer;pollution monitoring;quality attributes approach;reactive sensor middleware;reactive systems solution;technology development","","","21","","","","13-16 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

PaaS hides administration complexities of the underlying infrastructure such as the physical or virtual machines. This abstraction is achieved through advanced automation and OS-level multi-tenant containers. However, the on-demand procurement, unpredictable workloads and auto-scaling result in rapid increase and decrease of containers. This causes undesired utilization of Cloud resources and energy wastage that can be avoided with real time planning. Hence, the main challenge of a PaaS Cloud provider is to regularly plan and optimize the placement of containers on Cloud machines. However, the service-driven constraints regarding containers and spatial constraints regarding machines make SLA-aware resource allocation non-trivial. This relatively novel ""Service Consolidation"" problem is a variant of multi-dimensional bin-packing and hence NP-hard. In this work, we concretely frame this problem by leveraging the definition of Machine Reassignment model proposed by Google for the ROADEF/EURO challenge and characterize it for Open Shift PaaS. We apply Metaheuristic search to discover best (re) allocation solutions on Clouds of varying scales. We compare four state of the art algorithms as problem properties change in datasets and evaluate their performance against a variety of metrics including objective function score, machines used, utilization, resource contention, SLA violations, migrations and energy consumption. Finally, we present a policy-led ranking of solutions to obscure the complexity of individual metrics and decide for the most preferred solution. Hence, we provide valuable insights for SLA-aware resource management in PaaS Clouds.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-7881-6; POD:978-1-4799-7882-3","10.1109/UCC.2014.38","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7027505","Cloud Computing;Open Shift;Optimization;PaaS;Resource Allocation;SLA Violations;Service Consolidation;Service Level Agreement (SLA);Service Migration","Cloud computing;Computational modeling;Containers;Google;Monitoring;Planning;Resource management","bin packing;cloud computing;computational complexity;contracts;operating systems (computers);optimisation;planning;resource allocation;search problems","Google;NP-hard problem;OS-level multitenant containers;Open Shift PaaS clouds;ROADEF/EURO challenge;SLA violations;SLA-aware resource allocation;SLA-aware resource management;auto-scaling;cloud computing;cloud machines;cloud resource utilization;energy consumption;energy wastage;machine reassignment model;metaheuristic search;metaheuristics-based optimization;metaheuristics-based planning;migrations;multidimensional bin-packing;objective function score;on-demand procurement;platform as a service model;policy-led solution ranking;real time planning;resource contention;service consolidation problem;service-driven constraints;spatial constraints;unpredictable workloads","","2","24","","","","8-11 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In practical, with the combination of task and role, the TRBAC model associates the user with permission indirectly, makes the static and dynamic double control come true and assigns the permission according to the actual needs.

One type of Cloud, which provides platform resources including all the elements of application runtime environment, is regarded as PaaS Cloud. The management of PaaS Cloud is a complex task, up to the point, where manual operation is hard to be cost effective. As the application runtime environment is supported by a set of dynamically composed, distributed elements. What is more, in order to achieve a management target, multiple operations have to be applied over the distributed and heterogeneous elements of PaaS Cloud. To improve the management of PaaS Cloud, this paper proposes to support the configuration and deployment of application runtime environment in PaaS Cloud with an autonomous engine. The automation is enabled by the definition of a domain-specific information model, which captures all the related information with the same abstractions, describing the application runtime environment, PaaS Cloud infrastructure and management targets. On top of that, a technique based on Satisfiability is described, which automatically analyses the state of the managed objects and plans required operations for maintaining it. The result from a case study is provided to validate the feasibility of this approach.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-4093-6; POD:978-1-4799-4092-9; USB:978-1-4799-4094-3","10.1109/CloudCom.2014.80","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7037768","Autonomic Systems;Cloud Computing;Model Based Management;Platform as a Service;Satisfiability","Computational modeling;Engines;Middleware;Runtime environment;Virtual machining","cloud computing;computability","PaaS cloud computing;PaaS cloud management;application runtime environment configuration;distributed elements;domain-specific information model;heterogeneous elements;model-based autonomous engine;satisfiability","","0","7","","","","15-18 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

SCEs typically use the capabilities of an Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) which serves as the messaging hub between the composed services aiming at ensuring their integration. Together, an SCE and ESB solution comprise the service middleware required for the definition and execution of service-based composite applications. Offering a service middleware solution as a service creates a PaaS offering that allows the service consumers to share the service middleware solution in a multi-tenant manner. However, multi-tenancy support for service middleware solutions remains an open issue. For this purpose, in this work we introduce a general architecture for the realization of a multi-tenant service middleware PaaS solution. This architecture is prototypically realized based on open-source, multi-tenant ESB and SCE solutions. The resulting service middleware provides configurability for service compositions, tenant-aware messaging, and tenant-based administration and management of the SCE and the ESB. We also present an empirical evaluation of the multi-tenant service middleware with focus on the SCE. The results of these experiments show a performance degradation within acceptable limits when scaling the number of tenants and tenant users.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-7881-6; POD:978-1-4799-7882-3","10.1109/UCC.2014.37","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7027504","Cloud middleware;Multi-tenancy;PaaS;Performance Evaluation","Business;Cloud computing;Computer architecture;Data models;Databases;Engines","cloud computing;middleware","ESB;enterprise service bus;middleware PaaS solution;middleware empirical evaluation;multitenant service middleware;platform-as-a-service;service composition;service composition engine;service integration;service-based composite applications;tenant-aware messaging;tenant-based administration","","1","30","","","","8-11 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Matching both the requirements and resources represents a unique challenge: While requirements are generally defined in relatively abstract form and defined as system-wide parameters, the resources are concrete, low-level entities that, by themselves, are only of marginal influence on the requirements. In order to establish a relationship between these two requires both the agglomeration of properties into more abstract ones as well as refining requirements in more detailed, concrete ones, both of which can often only be done to a certain degree. This paper presents a vision how both aspects can be brought to the same level and introduces an approach enhancing component-based cloud applications with non-functional properties in the context of an integrated programming model. This allows developers of such applications to formally declare properties that may influence the application during runtime and document the expectations regarding non-functional aspects of the overall system. This can be used to ensure the health of the application and, in case requirements are violated, actions like the deployment of additional resources can be performed in order to alleviate any degradation of its non-functional state, either by evaluating, choosing and performing pre-defined actions automatically or by manual administrative intervention.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-5841-2; POD:978-1-4799-5842-9","10.1109/ICCAC.2014.32","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7024048","cloud applications;components;platform-as-a-service;programming model","Concrete;Current measurement;Middleware;Monitoring;Programming;Quality of service;Runtime","cloud computing;middleware;object-oriented programming","administrative intervention;cloud PaaS;component-based cloud applications;integrated programming model;middleware;nonfunctional properties;nonfunctional requirements;platform-as-a-service clouds","","6","31","","","","8-12 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Mathematical optimization is one of the domains, which benefit from cloud computing by using additional computing power for optimization problems to reduce the calculation time. Of course this is also true for our field of metaheuristic optimization. Metaheuristics provide powerful methods to solve a wide range of optimization problems and may be used as a foundation for a data analysis service. Due to the deficiency of an agreed-upon reference architecture it is quit cumbersome to compare existing solutions regarding different kinds of aspects (e.g. scalability, custom extensions, workflow, etc.). Besides the usual user working with an optimization service we also have those who are responsible for architecting and implementing these systems. The lack of a list of requirements and any formal reference architecture makes it even harder to improve those systems. For that reason we have raised the following questions: i) what are the requirements, ii) what are the commonalities of existing optimization software, and iii) can we deduce a reference architecture for a cloud-based optimization service? This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of current research projects and important requirements in the context of optimization services, which then leads to the definition of a reference architecture and forms the base of any further evaluation. We also present our own hybrid cloud-based optimization service (OaaS), which is built upon the PaaS-approach of Windows Azure. OaaS defines a generic and extensible service which can be adapted to support custom optimization scenarios.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-4568-9; POD:978-1-4799-4567-2; USB:978-1-4799-4569-6","10.1109/APCASE.2014.6924464","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6924464","","Algorithm design and analysis;Cloud computing;Computer architecture;Data analysis;Optimization;Servers","cloud computing;optimisation","OaaS;PaaS-approach;cloud computing;cloud-based optimization service;commercial community;custom optimization scenario;data analysis service;mathematical optimization;metaheuristic optimization;optimization software;optimization-as-a-service;platform-as-a-service;scientific community","","0","40","","","","10-12 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
